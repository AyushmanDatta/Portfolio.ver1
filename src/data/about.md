# Intro

Hello, I'm Ayushman Datta, an undergraduate student at SRMIST Chennai, deeply passionate about coding and immersed in the fascinating realm of AI computing. My journey includes enriching internships at Calcutta University and the startup Learnabyte, where I honed my skills and delved into real-world applications. SRMIST has been my playground for mastering programming, algorithms, and data structures. Currently exploring the vast potential of AI, I am enthusiastic about creating transformative solutions. Beyond academics, I'm a dedicated learner, always ready for fresh challenges. Let's connect and together, let's code the future!
